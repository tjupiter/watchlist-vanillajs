# watchlist-vanillajs

Watchlist Demo site created with VanillaJs. The site fetches data from OMDB API and displays movies in cards 
which you can add to your watchlist. The watchlist is stored in localStorage. 

It definitely needs a touch up on the CSS and the code as well but it is working for now. 

The next step is to re-create it with React.
